# 🛡️ Clickjacking Vulnerability Demo — Ethical Hacking Project

As part of my cybersecurity skills development, I built this Clickjacking demonstration to showcase how attackers can trick users into taking unintended actions on trusted websites.

---

## 🔎 What I Did

✅ Created a malicious HTML page that frames a legitimate site (in this case, Quizlet) using an iframe  
✅ Overlaid a fake button ("🎁 Claim Your Gift!") to simulate a social engineering lure  
✅ Demonstrated how the website is vulnerable due to missing `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers  
✅ Explained prevention techniques like frame-busting scripts and secure HTTP response headers

## 💡 Key Takeaways

🔒 Clickjacking can lead to unauthorized clicks and actions, seriously impacting user trust and security.  
🔒 Web developers should enforce proper security headers to prevent these exploits.

## 📝 Why This Matters

This project gave me hands-on exposure to a real-world web security issue and strengthened my understanding of both the attack surface and the defensive measures needed to mitigate it.

## 📄 Ethical Note

This demonstration was created **solely for educational and ethical hacking purposes**. No actual harm was done to Quizlet or any other third party, and no personal data was compromised.
